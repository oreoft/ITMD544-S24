ITMD544-S24

## Introduction

Welcome to the ITMD544-S24 project! This project is an assignment project for my IIT Study 544 course.

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase my course assignments and academic progress.

You can click on the links below and then view the information on each lab's published page.

### Lab1 - [Link](lab-1)

This project is a demonstration of automatic deployment of a static page using GitHub and Azure. It contains sample code
for a self-introduction page, primarily aimed at verifying the deployment process. The repository showcases how code
pushed to GitHub can automatically trigger a build and deploy process, seamlessly integrating development with
deployment.

Please visit the Lab1 [Link](lab-1) to see more details.

### Lab2 - [Link](lab-2)

- You are required to host an api that allows CRUD operation - Create, Read, Update and Delete.
- You need to use a backend data storage for the Object.
- Asa minimum you need to have one entity for this operation.

Please visit the Lab [Link](lab-2) to see more details.

### Lab3 - [Link](lab-3)

- You are required to host an api that allows CRUD operation - Create, Read, Update and Delete.
- You need to use a backend data storage for the Object.
- Asa minimum you need to have one entity for this operation.

## Final Project - [Link](tauri://localhost/final-project)

Launch a web application, hosted with its source code on GitHub, featuring both backend and frontend components. This
project should demonstrate your ability to integrate various technologies and concepts learned throughout the course.

- API Integration: Develop two APIs: one interfacing with a database and another connecting to a third-party service.
  Utilize free APIs from Public APIs for guidance. Your database API must interact with at
  least three tables, showcasing ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities. Example: A database tracking books, their
  authors, and topics.
- Frontend Application: Create a simple frontend that consumes data from both your database API and the third-party API.
  Example: Displaying weather information to support a conference scheduling feature.
- ORM Usage: Implement ORM functionality using either Prisma or TypeORM to manage database operations efficiently.
- Authentication and Security: Secure your application using token-based authentication methods such as Active
  Directory, Firebase, or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
